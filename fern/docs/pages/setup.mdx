## Quick Start

This guide will help you get Airweave up and running locally. 

<Note>
For production deployments on your own infrastructure, [reach out to us](mailto:support@airweave.ai).
</Note>
### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- Git installed
- Docker and Docker Compose installed

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/airweave-ai/airweave.git
cd airweave
```

### 2. Build and Run

The simplest way to get started is using our start script:

```bash
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

This will:
- Build all necessary Docker containers
- Start the PostgreSQL database
- Launch the FastAPI backend
- Start the React frontend
- Initialize a local Weaviate instance

## Accessing the Application

Once everything is running, you can access:

- Frontend Dashboard: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- API Documentation: [http://localhost:8001/docs](http://localhost:8001/docs)
- Weaviate Console: [http://localhost:8087](http://localhost:8087)


## Common Issues

### Port Conflicts
If you see port conflicts:
1. Check if any services are using ports 8080, 8001, or 8087
2. Update the ports in `docker-compose.yml`
3. Restart the application

### Database Connection
If the database connection fails:
1. Verify PostgreSQL is running
2. Check your `.env` configuration
3. Ensure the database is initialized

## Next Steps

Now that Airweave is running:
- [Add your first source](/sources)
- [Configure sync schedules](/sync)
- [Set up vector databases](/vector-dbs)
- [Explore the API](/api)
