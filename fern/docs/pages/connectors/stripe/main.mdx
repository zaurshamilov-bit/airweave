## Overview

The Stripe connector allows you to sync data from Stripe into Airweave, making it available for search and retrieval by your agents.

## Configuration


### StripeSource

Stripe source implementation.

This connector retrieves data from various Stripe objects, yielding them as entities
through their respective schemas. The following resource endpoints are used:

  - /v1/balance
  - /v1/balance_transactions
  - /v1/charges
  - /v1/customers
  - /v1/events
  - /v1/invoices
  - /v1/payment_intents
  - /v1/payment_methods
  - /v1/payouts
  - /v1/refunds
  - /v1/subscriptions

Each resource endpoint may use Stripe's pagination (has_more + starting_after) to
retrieve all objects. Fields are mapped to the entity schemas defined in entities/stripe.py.
