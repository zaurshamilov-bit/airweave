## Setting Up Your Zendesk OAuth Application

Zendesk requires you to create your own OAuth application (BYOC - Bring Your Own Credentials) to connect with Airweave. Follow these steps to set up your OAuth client:

### Step 1: Create OAuth Client in Zendesk

1. Log into your Zendesk Admin Center
2. Navigate to **Apps and integrations** → **APIs** → **OAuth clients**
3. Click **Add OAuth client** on the right side

### Step 2: Configure OAuth Client

Fill out the OAuth client form with the following details:

<ParamField path="Name" type="string" required={true}>
  **Example:** `Airweave`

  This name will be shown to users during the authorization flow.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Description" type="string" required={false}>
  **Example:** `Airweave connector for syncing Zendesk data`

  Optional description visible during authorization.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Company" type="string" required={false}>
  **Example:** `Your Company Name`

  Helps users understand who they're granting access to.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Identifier" type="string" required={true}>
  **Example:** `airweave`

  This becomes your **Client ID**. You can use the auto-generated value or customize it.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Type client" type="enum" required={true}>
  **Must be:** `Confidential`

  <Warning>
    **Important:** Select "Confidential", not "Public". Public clients will not work with Airweave.
  </Warning>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Redirect URLs" type="string" required={true}>
  Enter your Airweave callback URL. Use the appropriate URL for your environment:

  - **Production:** `https://api.airweave.ai/source-connections/callback`
  - **Development:** `https://api.dev-airweave.com/source-connections/callback`
  - **Local:** `http://localhost:8001/source-connections/callback`

  <Note>
    The redirect URL must match exactly (including protocol and trailing slashes). For localhost, `http://` is required.
  </Note>
</ParamField>

### Step 3: Save and Generate Secret

1. Click **Save**
2. After saving, a **Secret** field will appear with your client secret
3. **Copy the entire secret** immediately - it will only be shown once in full
4. Click **Save** again to finalize

<Warning>
  **Security Note:** The client secret will only be displayed fully once. After clicking Save, you'll only see the first 9 characters. Store it securely!
</Warning>

### Step 4: Activate the OAuth Client

1. Find your OAuth client in the OAuth clients list
2. Change the **Status** from **Inactive** to **Active**
3. Save the changes

<Note>
  The OAuth client must be in "Active" status to accept authorization requests. If it's inactive, you'll receive an "Invalid Authorization Request" error.
</Note>

### Step 5: Configure in Airweave

When creating a Zendesk connection in Airweave, you'll need to provide:

1. **Subdomain:** Your Zendesk subdomain only (e.g., `mycompany` NOT `mycompany.zendesk.com`)
2. **Client ID:** The identifier you set in Step 2
3. **Client Secret:** The secret you copied in Step 3

<CodeBlock title="Example Configuration">
```json
{
  "config": {
    "subdomain": "mycompany"
  },
  "authentication": {
    "client_id": "airweave",
    "client_secret": "your-secret-here"
  }
}
```
</CodeBlock>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid Authorization Request Error">
    **Cause:** Your OAuth client is inactive or misconfigured.

    **Solution:**
    - Verify the OAuth client status is "Active"
    - Ensure the client type is set to "Confidential"
    - Check that the redirect URL exactly matches your Airweave callback URL
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Client Secret Not Working">
    **Cause:** Incomplete secret copied or secret regenerated.

    **Solution:**
    - Make sure you copied the entire secret (it may extend past the visible text box)
    - If needed, click the "Regenerate" button to generate a new secret
    - Copy the new secret immediately and update it in Airweave
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Redirect URI Mismatch">
    **Cause:** The redirect URL in your OAuth client doesn't match Airweave's callback URL.

    **Solution:**
    - Verify the redirect URL is exactly: `https://api.airweave.ai/source-connections/callback`
    - Check for trailing slashes, protocol (http/https), and exact domain match
    - For local development, ensure you're using `http://` not `https://`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Required Scopes

Airweave requires the following Zendesk OAuth scopes:

- `read` - Read access to tickets, users, organizations, and comments
- `write` - Write access for updating ticket data (optional, for future features)

These scopes are automatically included in the authorization request.
