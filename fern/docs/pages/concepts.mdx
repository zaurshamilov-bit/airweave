Understanding the core building blocks of Airweave.

## Source

A **Source** is a data integration that knows how to connect to and extract data from external systems. Sources define authentication requirements, configuration options, and the specific entities they can extract.

Examples: Gmail, GitHub, Notion, PostgreSQL, Stripe

## Collection

A **Collection** is a searchable knowledge base composed of one or more source connections. Collections provide a unified search interface across all connected data sources.

- Contains multiple source connections
- Provides unified search API endpoint
- Maintains vector embeddings for semantic search

## Source Connection

A **Source Connection** links a specific source to a collection with configured credentials and settings. Each connection represents an authenticated instance of a source within a collection.

## White Labels

**White Labels** enable customization of the Airweave interface for different organizations or use cases. They control branding, available sources, and platform behavior.

- Custom branding and styling
- Source filtering and permissions
- Organization-specific configurations

## Entities

**Entities** are the structured data objects extracted from sources and stored in collections. Each source defines its own entity types based on the data it can extract.

- Threads, messages, and attachments from Gmail
- Repositories, files, and commits from GitHub
- Pages, databases, and blocks from Notion
- Tables, rows, and schemas from PostgreSQL
