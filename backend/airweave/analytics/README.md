# Airweave Analytics Module

This module provides PostHog analytics integration for Airweave, enabling comprehensive tracking of user behavior, business metrics, and system performance.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The analytics module is organized into several components:

- **`service.py`**: Core PostHog integration service
- **`decorators/`**: Decorators for automatic tracking of API endpoints and operations
- **`events/`**: Business event tracking classes for high-level metrics
- **`config.py`**: Analytics configuration (integrated into core config)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

Add these variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
# PostHog Configuration
POSTHOG_API_KEY=phc_your_api_key_here
POSTHOG_HOST=https://app.posthog.com
ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true
```

### 2. Basic Usage

```python
from airweave.analytics import analytics, business_events

# Track a custom event
analytics.track_event(
    event_name="custom_event",
    distinct_id="user_123",
    properties={"key": "value"}
)

# Track business events
business_events.track_organization_created(
    organization_id=org_id,
    user_id=user_id,
    properties={"plan": "trial"}
)
```

### 3. Using Decorators

```python
from airweave.analytics import track_api_endpoint, track_search_operation

@track_api_endpoint("create_collection")
async def create_collection(ctx: ApiContext, ...):
    # Your endpoint logic
    pass

@track_search_operation()
async def search_collection(ctx: ApiContext, query: str, ...):
    # Your search logic
    pass
```

## 🔧 Configuration

The analytics module respects these configuration options:

- `POSTHOG_API_KEY`: Your PostHog API key (required)
- `POSTHOG_HOST`: PostHog host URL (default: https://app.posthog.com)
- `ANALYTICS_ENABLED`: Enable/disable analytics (default: true)
- `ENVIRONMENT`: Deployment environment - added as property to all events

**Important**: Analytics events are emitted when `ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true`. Each event includes an `environment` property allowing you to filter by environment in PostHog dashboards. Control which environments emit events via their respective environment files.

### Environment Configuration Examples

```bash
# Production environment (.env.prod)
ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true
ENVIRONMENT=prd

# Development environment (.env.dev)
ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true
ENVIRONMENT=dev

# Local development (.env.local)
ANALYTICS_ENABLED=false
ENVIRONMENT=local

# Testing (.env.test)
ANALYTICS_ENABLED=false
ENVIRONMENT=test
```

### PostHog Dashboard Filtering

- **Production Only**: `environment = "prd"`
- **All Environments**: No filter
- **Exclude Local**: `environment != "local"`
- **Development Only**: `environment = "dev"`

## 💡 Best Practices

### 1. Use Decorators for Automatic Tracking
```python
@track_api_endpoint("endpoint_name")
async def my_endpoint(ctx: ApiContext, ...):
    # Automatically tracks timing, errors, and context
    pass
```

### 2. Track Business Events at Key Milestones
```python
# Track when user completes onboarding
business_events.track_first_sync_completed(ctx, sync_id, entities_count)
```

### 3. Include Rich Context
```python
analytics.track_event(
    event_name="custom_event",
    distinct_id=user_id,
    properties={
        "organization_name": ctx.organization.name,
        "plan": ctx.organization.plan,
        "feature": "advanced_search"
    },
    groups={"organization": str(ctx.organization.id)}
)
```

### 4. Handle Errors Gracefully
The analytics service automatically handles PostHog errors and logs them without affecting your application.

## 🔒 Privacy & Compliance

- All user data is sent to PostHog (ensure compliance with your privacy policy)
- Distinct IDs are not hashed by default; ensure compliance when sending user identifiers.
- Sensitive data should not be included in event properties
- Consider data retention policies in PostHog

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Events not appearing in PostHog**
   - Check `POSTHOG_API_KEY` is set correctly
   - Verify `ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true`
   - Check logs for PostHog errors

2. **High event volume**
   - PostHog free tier: 1M events/month
   - Consider sampling for high-volume events
   - Use `ANALYTICS_ENABLED=false` to disable

3. **Performance impact**
   - Analytics calls are async and non-blocking
   - Errors are logged but don't affect application flow
   - Consider batching for high-frequency events
